# Unicorn-EDA-and-Visualization
In this project, our main goal is to perform data cleaning on a dataset containing information about various unicorn companies, which are privately held startup companies valued at over $1 billion. The dataset may have inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues that need to be addressed to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
Once the data has been thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed, we move on to the visualization phase. 

Data Exploration: We start by creating exploratory visualizations to gain insights into the distribution of unicorn companies across different industries, regions, funding rounds, valuations, and more.

Interactive Dashboards: Utilizing Tableau's interactive features, we build dynamic dashboards that enable users to filter, drill down, and explore the data interactively.

Comparative Analysis: We compare unicorn companies based on various factors such as funding raised, market capitalization, employee count, and revenue. These visual comparisons provide valuable insights into the unicorn ecosystem.

Geospatial Visualization: We create geographical visualizations to display the distribution of unicorn companies across different countries and regions. This helps identify unicorn hotspots and emerging markets.

Time Series Analysis: To understand the growth and performance of unicorn companies over time, we visualize temporal trends using line charts, bar charts, or other relevant plots.
